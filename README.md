The consent layer for AI.
Voluntary Participation
Contribution layer. Your natural interactions help train AI through RLHF—with full consent, transparent tracking, and fair compensation. When you contribute, you earn Contribution Points that convert into real cash, funded by AI companies that pay Zamani Labs for transparent, consented model-improvement data.
